Let $DP,DQ$ meet $\Gamma\coloneqq(ABC)$ again at $S,T$, let $PQ$ meet $BC$ at $R$, and let $AT$ meet $EF$ at $K$. Note that $P$ is on the polar of $A$, so $A$ is on the polar of $P$. In addition,
\[
	(P,K;E,F)\stackrel{A}{=}(P,T;C,B)_\Gamma\stackrel{Q}{=}(R,D;C,B)=-1
\]
by Ceva-Menelaus. Thus $AT$ is the polar of $P$, so $AT\perp IP$. Similarly, $AS\perp IQ$. It follows that
\[
	\measuredangle{QIP}=\measuredangle{SAT}=\measuredangle{STA}+\measuredangle{AST}=\measuredangle{DPA}+\measuredangle{AQD}
\]
as desired.
