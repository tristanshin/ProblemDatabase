Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle{PAB}$. Then
\[
	\measuredangle{PDA}=\measuredangle{PAD}+\measuredangle{DPA}=2\measuredangle{PBA}=\measuredangle{POA}
\]
so $O$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle{DAP}$. Since $O$ also lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AP$ and lies on the opposite side of line $AP$ as $D$, we must have that $O$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle{ADP}$. Similarly, $O$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle{PCB}$. But $O$ clearly lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, so we are done.
