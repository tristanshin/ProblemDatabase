By Power of a Point, $AY\cdot AB=AP\cdot AC$ and $CX\cdot CB=CQ\cdot CA$. Let $AC=b$ and $AP=w$. By the condition, $CQ=\frac{b}{2}-w$. Thus, $AY\cdot AB=wb$ and $CX\cdot CB=\left(\frac{b}{2}-w\right)b$. Now, let the circumcircle of $BXY$ intersect $AC$ at $J$ and $K$ (possibly complex). By Power of a Point, $AY\cdot AB=AJ\cdot AK$ and $CX\cdot CB=CJ\cdot CK$. Note that $CJ=b-AJ$ and $CK=b-AK$, so $CX\cdot CB=\left(b-AJ\right)\left(b-AK\right)$. Substituting in what we know, $AJ\cdot AK=wb$ and $\left(b-AJ\right)\left(b-AK\right)=\left(\frac{b}{2}-w\right)b$. There is a unique monic quadratic $P\left(x\right)$ with roots $AJ$ and $AK$. We would have $P\left(0\right)=wb$ and $P\left(b\right)=\left(\frac{b}{2}-w\right)b$. But notice $P\left(x\right)=\left(x-\frac{b}{2}\right)\left(x-2w\right)$ satisfies these same conditions, so this is $P\left(x\right)$. But $\frac{b}{2}$ is a root of $P\left(x\right)$, so either $AJ$ or $AK$ is $\frac{b}{2}$, meaning either $J$ or $K$ is $M$ and thus $M$ lies on the circumcircle of $BXY$ and $BXMY$ is cyclic.
