Let $S$ be a set of towns, and define a \vocab{capital} of $S$ to be a town that cannot be swept away by any other town in $S$. Proceed by induction on $n$, with the base case being trivial. Label the towns as $1,\dots,n$ from left to right.

Consider the largest non-endpoint bulldozer, and WLOG let be the right bulldozer of town $k$. By the inductive hypothesis, there is a unique capital $C$ of $\{1,\dots,k\}$. It turns out that $C$ is also the unique capital of $\{1,\dots,n\}$. To see why, note that $C$ cannot be swept away by any town to the right of $k$ for size reasons, so $C$ is a capital of $\{1,\dots,n\}$. Furthermore, $k$ can sweep away any town to the right of $k$, so any capitals of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ must be in $\{1,\dots,k\}$. Since $C$ is unique, this implies the result.
