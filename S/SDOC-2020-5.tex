Let $p$ be the probability that it rains today and $q$ be the probability that it rains tomorrow. Then we know the following:
	\begin{align*}
		q &= 0.5p+0.2(1-p) \\
		0.5 = \PP(\text{wind today}) &= 0.7p+0.2(1-p) \\
		\PP(\text{wind tmrw}) &= 0.7q+0.2(1-q)
	\end{align*}
	The second equation gives us that $p=0.6$. The first equation gives us that $q=0.38$. The third equation gives us that $\PP(\text{wind tmrw})=0.39$ as desired.
