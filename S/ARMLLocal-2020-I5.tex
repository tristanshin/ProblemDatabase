Suppose that a student $S$ has been on $T(S)$ teams. Consider the quantity $\sum T(S)$, where the sum is over all $21$ students $S$. Each team that has been formed will be counted $3$ times by this sum --- once in the count $T(S)$ for each student $S$ in the team. Since there have been $56$ teams, it follows that $\sum T(S)=3\cdot56=168$. So the average value of $T(S)$ is $\frac{168}{21}=\mathbf{8}$.
