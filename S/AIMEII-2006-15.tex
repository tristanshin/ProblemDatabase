Consider $\triangle{XYZ}$ with side lengths $x,y,z$; the equations imply that the altitudes are $\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{6}$. Then $\triangle{XYZ}$ is similar to a triangle with side lengths $4,5,6$, which has area $\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{4}$. Thus we have that
\[
	\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{4}\cdot\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2=\frac{1}{2}\cdot x\cdot\frac{1}{4},
\]
so $\frac{x}{4}=\frac{2}{15\sqrt{7}}$. Then
\[
	x+y+z=\frac{2}{15\sqrt{7}}(4+5+6)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}
\]
so the answer is $009$.
