We require $\frac{n+5}{2}$ and $\frac{10n}{n+5}$ to both be integers. The former requires $n$ to be odd, and the latter requires $n+5$ to divide $10(n+5)-10n=50$. As a result, $n+5$ is an even divisor of $50$ that is larger than $5$. Thus $n+5$ is either $10$ or $50$. But if $n+5=10$, then $n=5$, contradicting the fact that $n$ and $5$ are distinct. Thus $n+5=50$, so $n=45$.
