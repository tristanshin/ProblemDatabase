Prove that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that the following statement is true:

Consider an integer $n>1$, and a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ points in the plane such that the distance between any two different points in $S$i s at least $1$. It follows that there is a line $\ell$ separating $\mathcal{S}$ such that the distance from any point of $\mathcal{S}$ to $\ell$i s at least $cn^{-1/3}$.

(A line $\ell$ separates a set of points $\mathcal{S}$ if some segment joining two points in $\mathcal{S}$ crosses $\ell$.)
