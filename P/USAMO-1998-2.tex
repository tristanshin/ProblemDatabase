Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be concentric circles, with $\mathcal{C}_2$ in the interior of $\mathcal{C}_1$. From a point $A$ on $\mathcal{C}_1$, one draws the tangent $AB$ to $\mathcal{C}_2$ ($B\in\mathcal{C}_2$). Let $C$ be the second point of intersection of $AB$ and $\mathcal{C}_1$, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $AB$. A line passing through $A$ intersects $\mathcal{C}_2$ at $E$ and $F$ in such a way that the perpendicular bisectors of $DE$ and $CF$ intersect at a point $M$ on $AB$. Find, with proof, the ratio $\frac{AM}{MC}$.
