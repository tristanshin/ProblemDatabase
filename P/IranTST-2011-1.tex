In acute triangle $ABC$, $\angle{B}$ is greater than $\angle{C}$. Let $M$ is midpoint of $BC$ and let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$, respectively. Let $K$ and $L$ be the midpoints of $ME$ and $MF$, respectively. If $KL$ intersects the line through $A$ parallel to $BC$ at $T$, prove that $TA=TM$.
