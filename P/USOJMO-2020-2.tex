Let $\omega$ be the incircle of a fixed equilateral triangle $ABC$. Let $\ell$ be a variable line that is tangent to $\omega$ and meets the interior of segments $BC$ and $CA$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. A point $R$ is chosen such that $PR=PA$ and $QR=QB$. Find all possible locations of the point $R$, over all choices of $\ell$.
