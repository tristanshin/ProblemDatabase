Submit an integer between $0$ and $100$ inclusive as your answer to this problem. Suppose that $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are the medians of the smallest $50\%$ and largest $50\%$ of submissions for this question. Your goal is to have your submission close to $D=Q_3-Q_1$. If you submit $N$, your score will be $2-2\sqrt{\frac{\left|N-D\right|}{\max\left\{D,100-D\right\}}}$.
