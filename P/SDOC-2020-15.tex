Let $n$ be a positive integer. Define $\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ that are relatively prime to $n$ and $\sigma(n)$ to be the sum of all positive integers that divide $n$. Compute the \textbf{number of} positive integers $n<100$ for which
\[
	\varphi(n)+\sigma(n)\leq2n+1.
\]
