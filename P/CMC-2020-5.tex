There are $2000$ positive integers written on a blackboard. Every minute, Zuming erases two of the numbers and replaces them by their sum, difference, product, or quotient. For example, if Zuming erases the numbers $6$ and $3$, he may replace them with one of the numbers in the set $\{6+3,6-3,3-6,6\times3,6\div3,3\div6\}=\{9,3,-3,18,2,\frac{1}{2}\}$. After $2019$ minutes, Zuming writes the single number $-2020$ on the blackboard. Show that it was possible for Zuming to have ended up with the single number $2020$ instead, using the same rules and starting with the same $2020$ integers.
