Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $AB>BC$ and let $D$ be a variable point on the line segment $BC$. Let $E$ be the point on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ lying on the opposite side of $BC$ from $A$ such that $\angle{BAE}=\angle{DAC}$. Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABD$ and let $J$ be the incenter of triangle $ACE$. Prove that the line $IJ$ passes through a fixed point, that is independent of $D$.
