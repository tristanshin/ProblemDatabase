Let $PAB$ and $PCD$ be triangles such that $PA=PB$, $PC=PD$, and $PAC$ and $BPD$ are both lines in this order. A circle $S_1$ passing through $A,C$ intersects a circle $S_2$ passing through $B,D$ at distinct points $X,Y$. Prove that the circumcenter of $\triangle{PXY}$ is the midpoint of the centers of $S_1,S_2$.
