Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incircle $\omega$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Define $I$ to be the center of $\omega$ and $D,E,F$ to be the points where $\omega$ touches $BC,CA,AB$ respectively. Let line $AI$ meet $BC$ at $J$ and $\Gamma$ again at $M$, and let $N$ be the point diametrically opposite $M$ on $\Gamma$. Suppose that $K$ is a point on $ID$ such that $JK$ is parallel to $MD$. Let the perpendicular to $AI$ passing through $K$ intersect $IN$ at $Q$. Prove that $DQ\perp EF$.
