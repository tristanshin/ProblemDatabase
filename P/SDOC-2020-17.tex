Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. The \vocab{$A$-excircle} is the unique circle that is tangent to all three sides of $\triangle{ABC}$ but is not tangent to segments $AB$ and $AC$. Suppose that the $A$-excircle is centered at $I_A$ and touches side $BC$ at $D$. If $AD=9$, $DI_A=8$, and $AI_A=15$, compute the product $BC\cdot CA\cdot AB$.
