In a Taekwondo class of $21$ students, the students compete in ``sparring teams'' of three students. Suppose that there are $56$ different sparring teams that have ever been formed by the students in the class (here, two teams are the same if they consist of the same three students and different otherwise). Given that each student has been, on average, a part of $N$ different sparring teams, compute $N$.
