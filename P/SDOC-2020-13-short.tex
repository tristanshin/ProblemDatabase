Jen the Jiraffe is at the top corner of the fourth iteration of Sierpi\'nski's triangle with side length $16$ and trying to get to either of the two bottom corners (the zeroth iteration is a triangle, the first iteration is four triangles, and so on). Every second, she travels $1$ unit along one of the segments in the diagram. She will only travel downwards, unless there is no option to travel downwards. In this case, she will either move left until she can travel downwards again, or move right until she can travel downwards again. She stops when she reaches either of the two bottom corners.

Compute the number of ways there are for Jen the Jiraffe to reach either of the two bottom corners.
