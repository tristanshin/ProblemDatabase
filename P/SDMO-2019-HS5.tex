We call a divisor $d$ of a positive integer $n$ \emph{special} if $d+1$ is also a divisor of $n$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that at most half the positive divisors of a positive integer can be special.
	\item Determine all positive integers $n$ for which exactly half the positive divisors of $n$ are special.
\end{enumerate}
