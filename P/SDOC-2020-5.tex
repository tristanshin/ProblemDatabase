If it rains today, there is a $50\%$ chance that it will rain tomorrow. Otherwise, there is only a $20\%$ chance. If it rains on a day, there is a $70\%$ chance that the wind that day will be over $20$ mph. Otherwise, there is only a $20\%$ chance.
	
	Suppose that there is a $50\%$ chance that the wind will be over $20$ mph today. Compute the probability that the wind will be over $20$ mph tomorrow.
