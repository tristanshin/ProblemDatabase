Let $n\geq2$ be an integer. Let $P(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ be a nonconstant $n$-variable polynomial with real coefficients. Assume that whenever $r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n$ are real numbers, at least two of which are equal, we have $P(r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n)=0$. Prove that $P(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ cannot be written as the sum of fewer than $n!$ monomials. (A monomial is a polynomial of the form $cx_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\dots x_n^{d_n}$, where $c$ is a nonzero real number and $d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n$ are nonnegative integers.)
