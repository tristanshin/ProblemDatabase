Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=7,BC=8,CA=9$. Points $J$ and $K$ lie on side $BC$ such that $J$ lies on the incircle of $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\angle{BAJ}=\angle{CAK}$. The circumcircle of $\triangle{AJK}$ meets sides $AB$ and $AC$ again at $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Line $JY$ meets line $AB$ at $M$, and line $KX$ meets line $AC$ at $N$. Line $MN$ meets line $BC$ at $P$. If the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ meet their opposite sides at $E$ and $F$ respectively, compute the area of $\triangle{PEF}$.
