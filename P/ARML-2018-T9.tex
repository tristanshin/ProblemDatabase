Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with diameter $\overline{XY}$ and center $O$, and let $\gamma$ be a circle with diameter $\overline{OY}$. Circle $\omega_1$ passes through $Y$ and intersects $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$ again at $A$ and $B$, respectively. Circle $\omega_2$ also passes through $Y$ and intersects $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$ again at $D$ and $C$, respectively. Given that $AB=1$, $BC=4$, $CD=2$, and $AD=7$, compute the sum of the areas of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$.
