Convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle $\Omega$ centered at $O$, and circumscribed about a circle $\omega$ with center $I$. Let $\omega$ be tangent to side $AB$ at $E$ and side $CD$ at $F$. Suppose the exterior angle bisectors of $\angle{DAB}$ and $\angle{ABC}$ meet at a point $X$, while the exterior angle bisectors of $\angle{BCD}$ and $\angle{CDA}$ meet at a point $Y$. Prove that lines $XE$, $YF$, and $OI$ are concurrent.
