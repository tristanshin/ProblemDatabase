Bill the Belociraptor is at the top corner of the fourth iteration of Sierpi\'nski's triangle with side length $16$ and trying to get to either of the two bottom corners (the zeroth iteration is a triangle, the first iteration is four triangles, and so on). However, he has no sense of direction. Every second, he uniformly randomly chooses a segment at the intersection that he is at (possibly even the segment which he just travelled on) and travels $1$ unit along the segment.

Compute the expected value of the number of seconds that it will take Bill the Belociraptor to reach either of the two bottom corners.
