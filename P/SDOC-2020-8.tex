There are $150$ pairs of twins that attend the South Dakota Oak College. On National Twin Day, all of these twins gather in the gymnasium and are seated (in a uniformly random order) in a circle with $300$ chairs. A prize is given to each pair of twins that sit next to each other. Compute the expected value of the number of pairs of twins that win a prize.
