For integers $m,n\geq1$, let $A(n,m)$ be the number of sequences $(a_1,\ldots,a_{nm})$ of integers satisfying the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Each integer $k$ with $1\leq k\leq n$ occurs exactly $m$ times in the sequence $(a_1,\ldots,a_{nm})$.
	\item If $i$, $j$, and $k$ are integers such that $1\leq i\leq nm$ and $1\leq j\leq k\leq n$, then $j$ occurs in the sequence $(a_1,\ldots,a_i)$ at least as many times as $k$ does.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that $A(n,m)=A(m,n)$.
