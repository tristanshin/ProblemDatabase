A finite set $S$ of points in the coordinate plane is called \emph{overdetermined} if $|S|\geq2$ and there exists a nonzero polynomial $P(t)$, with real coefficients and of degree at most $|S|-2$, satisfying $P(x)=y$ for every point $(x,y)\in S$. For each integer $n\geq2$, find the largest integer $k$ (in terms of $n$) such that there exists a set of $n$ distinct points that is \emph{not} overdetermined, but has $k$ overdetermined subsets.
