Two externally tangent circles are drawn inside triangle $ABC$ so that one is tangent to side $\overline{AB}$, the other is tangent to side $\overline{AC}$, and both are tangent to side $\overline{BC}$. Suppose that the product of the two circles' radii is $9$. Given that $AB+BC=35$ and $AC=13$, compute the sum of the two circles' radii.
