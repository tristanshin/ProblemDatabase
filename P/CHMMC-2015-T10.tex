Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y=x^2$. Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ in the plane intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points. If three of these points are $(-28,784)$, $(-2,4)$, and $(13,169)$, find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points.
